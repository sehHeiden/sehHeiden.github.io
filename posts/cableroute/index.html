                    <h1 id="sec:introduction">Introduction and Objectives</h1>
<p>The German power system is adding renewable energy sources in the north,
where wind energy plants reach their highest efficiency, due to higher
wind speeds. At the same time old power plants e.g.Â nuclear, hard coal
and lignite are being phased outÂ [^eser-frey_analyzing_2012]. These
older power plants were mainly located in southern and central Germany.
The energy sink, industrial and private demand, is not shifting north.
Therefore, the renewable energy has to be transported from north to
south which increases the congestion in the power grid. The amount of
offshore wind power, that the German energy system can use, can be
greatly increased by adding new power linesÂ <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>However, it is not enough to find the shortest route when building new
power lines. Other parameters have to be taken into consideration, as
the steepness of a road or the soil for example, play an important role
for the building cost of a road or pipelineÂ <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.
When planing the additional routes for a power grid, further aspects
such as legal regulations and acceptance by the local population have to
kept in mind. Also technical aspects, as the effects on the grid
stability are further points to take into
considerationÂ <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Due to the increasing demand for renewable energy wind offshore wind
turbines supplied 5.5Â % annual percentage in 2020 of the German energy
mixÂ <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The physical modelling in the power systems models ranges from not
modelling the grid at all to models that use of Kirchhoffs
lawsÂ <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. The calculation of a power system is
complex, because changing one edge changes the flow in all parts of
grid. Besides, the actual grid data are
confidentialÂ <sup id="fnref1:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. Some models not only
consider the grid of one nation, but consider neighbouring states or the
whole European power systemÂ <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. Older power grid
models are e.g.Â optimising the well fare, but economic modelling is not
sufficient for planning modern routes, as the aspect of environmental
sustainability, security of supply and the public acceptance play an
increasingly important roleÂ <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> in modern
planning.</p>
<p>In contrast to a GIS analysis, these other factors can be studied done
with a [MCDA]{acronym-label=&ldquo;MCDA&rdquo;
acronym-form=&ldquo;singular+full&rdquo;}Â <sup id="fnref2:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>.
Stakeholders as decision makers can be included and combined with an
expert systemÂ <sup id="fnref3:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The uncertainties associated with [MCDA]{acronym-label=&ldquo;MCDA&rdquo;
acronym-form=&ldquo;singular+abbrv&rdquo;} are data uncertainties, preferential
uncertainties and model uncertainties are investigated with a
sensitivity analysisÂ <sup id="fnref4:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> or
simulationÂ <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>. Both inter- and intra-criteria
preferential uncertaintiesÂ <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> can be
considered.</p>
<p>This paper aims to find potential paths for power lines by using the
Least Cost Path algorithm. Land usage and planning data are used to
estimate the costs arising by using the local area. The task was to
provide the Least Cost Path using a [wps]{acronym-label=&ldquo;wps&rdquo;
acronym-form=&ldquo;singular+full&rdquo;}. Beyond that, methods to reduce the needed
compute power for finding the Least Cost Path had to be studied.</p>
<h1 id="sec:methods">Methods</h1>
<p>The Least Cost Path algorithm is used to plan a potential,
cost-optimised route for a power line. The Least Cost Path algorithm is
a Dijkstra algorithmÂ <sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> applied on a raster map. The
vertices of the graph are the pixel centres, that are connected to the
eight neighbouring pixel centres via the edges. This makes it possible
to find routes on graphs that are not predefined, such as road networks.
The weights of the edges are the local costs of transit from one pixel
center to the neighbouring pixel center. The costs can be physical
costs, such as the local slope, but also can be composed of other
factors as the acceptance rate to transverse a given land usage. The
Least Cost Path algorithm consists of at least two successive steps. 1)
The first step is to aggregate the costs of travelling from the starting
point to a given set of end points. This step generates the aggregated
cost raster of travelling from the starting point to any point of the
cost raster. 2) In the next step the backtracking, the route of the
actual Least Cost Path is calculated. For each end point the path via
the lowest cost neighbour is taken until the starting point is reached.</p>
<p>Some implementations switch the roles of start and ending points, so
that either many start points and one single end point, or one single
end point and many end points can be used. In some implementations there
is an extra step between 1) and 2) that calculates cost-weight direction
raster, that encodes the direction of the shortest path to the starting
point as integer values.</p>
<p>We retrieve a set of different spacial data-sets from public sources as
a basis for creating the cost raster. The study area are the counties of
Cuxhaven and Osterholz in the state of Lower Saxony, Germany. Areas
protected by different European and National conservation laws are
provided by the German Environment Agency as [wfs]{acronym-label=&ldquo;wfs&rdquo;

OpenStreetMapÂ <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>. Local data as houses at Level of
Detail 1 are provided by the State Office for Geoinformation and Land
Surveying of Lower SaxonyÂ <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>. In addition,
local planning geodata for the land use are taken from &lsquo;Metropolplaner&rsquo;

BirdyÂ <sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup> connects to the [wps]{acronym-label=&ldquo;wps&rdquo;
acronym-form=&ldquo;singular+abbrv&rdquo;}, sends the cost raster, starting point,
end points and receives the resulting Least Cost Path. The initial
implementation of the Least Cost Path algorithm is based on the
implementation for the QGIS-Plugin &lsquo;Least Cost
Path&rsquo;Â <sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup> in version 1.0,
but refactored to optionally export the aggregated costs in a command
line tool. On top, the [wps]{acronym-label=&ldquo;wps&rdquo;
acronym-form=&ldquo;singular+abbrv&rdquo;} provides the complete Least Cost Path
algorithm as a single capability.</p>
<p>In order to compute intermediate cost raster the different vector layers
of the different entities are optionally filtered, buffered and then
rasterised. Filtering the layers of the vector files for special
attributes enables further differentiation. For example, it is possible
to differentiate between heath and uncultivated land in the land cover.
Adding a buffer can be used either to convert a line object such as a
power line and a road into a polygon (with the correct physical width),
or to add minimum distance from an existing of planed area to the new
power line. Each of theses intermediate rasters are given a weight
(cost) which expresses the cost of using land covered by this layer. In
the final cost raster costs of all intermediate rasters are aggregated
with the maximum function. Thus, an area covered by several layers is
uniformly associated with the highest cost. Any place in the study area,
that is not covered by any layer and thus does not yet have a weight, is
given the default cost.</p>
<p>The costs have been grouped into five different levelsÂ (see
tableÂ <a href="#tab:1">1</a>{reference-type=&ldquo;ref&rdquo; reference=&ldquo;tab:1&rdquo;}), starting
from <em>Preferential</em> areas with very low costs, via <em>No restriction</em>s,
which is the default, used when no other layers are covering the local
area, to <em>Restricted</em>, <em>Strongly Restricted</em> and <em>Prohibited</em> areas with
high costs. These higher costs represent the degree to which a place
with this cost should be avoided, while routing the path. The ratio of
the higher costs to the lower costs equals the detour the algorithm is
willing to go. Thus, as <em>prohibited</em> areas describe a legal obligation,
not to use these areas or only to the utmost minimum, the weight that
resembles the costs for these types of areas is set especially high.<br>
All these layers are provided as vectors. The Least Cost Path algorithm
uses raster data. Rasterisation transforms a vector into a raster.
Rasterisation can be done in two different ways. In both ways, the
rasterisation can be imaged, as the old vector is superimposed on the
new raster grid with the new given resolution and the new affine
transformation and the coordinate reference system of the vector. Both
rasterisation techniques differ in the selection of the pixel, that
describe the original polygon. A pixels will be selected, if either the
centre of that pixel is overlapped by the geo-object, or any part of the
pixel is overlaid. Setting allÂ touched to True implies the version with
any part of the pixel selected. The version, where an overlapped pixel
centre is required, is setting the parameter allÂ touched to False.
AllÂ touched set to False is considered the default (see
figureÂ <a href="#fig:alltouched">1</a>{reference-type=&ldquo;ref&rdquo;
reference=&ldquo;fig:alltouched&rdquo;}).</p>

<p>All three steps of the generation of the Least Cost Path: generation of
the cost raster, aggregation and backtracking is shown with an example
for a cost raster of 50Â m resolution and allÂ touched set to False (see
<a href="#fig:costs2path">2</a>{reference-type=&ldquo;ref&rdquo; reference=&ldquo;fig:costs2path&rdquo;}).</p>
<p>The chosen implementation applies early stopping. Therefore, the costs
for points that are not needed to try to connect to the end point are
not aggregated (see figure
<a href="#fig:aggregation">[fig:aggregation]</a>{reference-type=&ldquo;ref&rdquo;
reference=&ldquo;fig:aggregation&rdquo;}). After finding an aggregated cost for
every end point, the aggregation stops and the backtracking starts.
Because the path ends at a power transformer, which is a building type,
the paths end at in a <em>Prohibited</em> area. Therefore, areas even further
away from the starting point have been explored first.</p>

<p>For low resolution rasterisation, with allÂ touched set to True will show
every detail, but the objects are enlarged. When allÂ touched is to False
the object only appears, when the is situated at the pixel centre. Thus,
this might be used as surrogate, that expresses the likelihood of the
object to be sampled and correlates with the object size compared to the
pixel size. At high resolution the set allÂ touched to True still
overestimates the object size, but the extent is limited. Setting
allÂ touched to False will include all objects for high resolution. This
setting is most realistic, because the over- and underestimation of the
object size is limited to half a pixel size in every direction. The best
method should be to use the percentage of the pixel coverage by the
object as weight, which is not possible. As an alternative, switching
between setting allÂ touched True and False may result in a better
assessment of the true costs. When superimposing the resulting cost
raster, these map will include both aspects of the correctness: showing
every detail and statistically distribute better the real cost. Another
method to achieve the same is to downsample high resolution raster.</p>
<h1 id="sec:results">Results</h1>
<p>In this chapter we want to show the different cost rasters, that were
created from the same set of layers at different resolutions. The Least
Cost Path is estimated from this set of rasters. In the last step the
Least Cost Path is computed from the medium resolution rasters and
compared with the Least Cost Paths computed from a high resolution
raster.</p>
<h2 id="subsec:cost-raster">Cost Raster</h2>
<p>The cost raster contains all the costs for the geographical region of
the study area. The different intermediate cost rasters in the study
area are aggregated by the maximum function. If the resolution is higher
than the object size, then the effect of setting allÂ touched to True or
False is limited. If allÂ touched is set to True and any part of the
pixel that is covered by the object, the whole pixel is attributed to
the object. This makes the object appear larger. This can be seen in
figureÂ <a href="#fig:costs_5m">3</a>{reference-type=&ldquo;ref&rdquo;
reference=&ldquo;fig:costs_5m&rdquo;}, which shows a detailed view of the costs for
the village of Beverstedt. To set allÂ touched to False is a better
description of the real size of the object for high resolution.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In contrast, if the resolution is smaller, allÂ touched set to False
leads to a loss of information for smaller objects. Since the default
cost is much smaller than the average cost, this method underestimates
the cost. The figureÂ <a href="#fig:costs_100m">4</a>{reference-type=&ldquo;ref&rdquo;
reference=&ldquo;fig:costs_100m&rdquo;} shows, that for the resolution of 100 m,
larger objects are still included in the map, but smaller objects, such
as roads, are only partially included.</p>

<h2 id="subsec:least-cost-paths">Least Cost Paths</h2>
<p>For each resolution the Least Cost Paths were estimated with the
allÂ touched set to False and True.</p>
<p>For the study, a starting point was chosen at a transformer about 6Â km
north of the container terminal Bremerhaven and an end point at a
transformer in the southeast of the Osterholz county.</p>
<p>The distance between the paths is calculated by the mean minimum
distance. For each vertex $P_i$ in the path $L_1$ the minimum distance
between the vertex $P_i$ and the path $L_2$ is calculated and then the
minimum distances are averaged (see
equationÂ <a href="#eq:1">[eq:1]</a>{reference-type=&ldquo;ref&rdquo; reference=&ldquo;eq:1&rdquo;}).
$$\label{eq:1}
d_{mean} = \frac{1}{|L_1|} \sum_{i=1}^{n} d_{min}(P_i, L_2) \Bigr\vert P_i \in L_1$$
This equation is used to measure the degree of similarity between the
paths. The distances are measured at the same resolution (different
setting for allÂ touched), and same setting of allÂ touched (different
resolution).</p>
<p>TableÂ <a href="#tab:2">[tab:2]</a>{reference-type=&ldquo;ref&rdquo; reference=&ldquo;tab:2&rdquo;} shows,
that the distance between two paths decreases with increasing
resolution. In addition, this tendency is depicted in
figureÂ <a href="#fig:paths_resolution">5</a>{reference-type=&ldquo;ref&rdquo;
reference=&ldquo;fig:paths_resolution&rdquo;} for the calculated cost paths of 5Â m
and 100Â m resolutions.</p>
<p>At the same time, the differences in the aggregated costs remain almost
constant. Thus the difference between the aggregated costs per
resolution decreases. Setting allÂ touched to False underestimates and to
True overestimates the costs.</p>

<p>:::</p>
<p>When estimating the distance between the Least Costs Paths from
allÂ touched set to True and allÂ touched set to False at the same
resolution, the mean minimum distance between the 100Â m resolution paths
is 1946.41Â m and between the 5Â m resolution paths is 126.04Â m. The
similarity between the allÂ touched set to False paths is higher, than
for setting to True. The distance for the 100Â m path to the 5Â m
resolution path is 243.42Â m for allÂ touched False and 2109.44Â m for
allÂ touched True.</p>
<p>When cross comparing the similarity between all paths set with
allÂ touched set to False and the similarity in between the same
resolution, the similarity in between the allÂ touched set to False paths
is higher, than for most paths of the same resolution. Namely except for
the highest resolution.</p>
<p>This behaviour is shown in
figureÂ <a href="#fig:paths_alltouched">6</a>{reference-type=&ldquo;ref&rdquo;
reference=&ldquo;fig:paths_alltouched&rdquo;}. On a more detailed level, it can be
seen, that the paths of allÂ touched False also converge directly to the
allÂ touched True paths, but the extent is smaller.</p>
<p>The zonal stat (see tableÂ <a href="#tab:3">[tab:3]</a>{reference-type=&ldquo;ref&rdquo;
reference=&ldquo;tab:3&rdquo;}) for a buffer of 100Â m (5Â m) around the paths has
been used, to estimate the percentage of each costs levels around the
paths. When using allÂ touched True at higher resolution the tendency is
to use a higher percentage of the <em>Preferential</em> Level and less of the
<em>NoRestriction</em> Level. There is no strong tendency for the allÂ touched
set to False Least Cost Paths.</p>

<h2 id="subsec:execution-time">Execution time</h2>
<p>In theory, the execution time increases by power of two with the
resolution, because higher resolutions result in a higher number of
pixels. A double logarithmic fit shows, that the execution time scales
with power of $2.1997  \pm 0.007$ of the inverse resolution.</p>
<p>The total execution time consists of two parts: the aggregation of the
costs and the back tracking of the least cost to find the path.</p>
<h2 id="subsec:faster-processing-of-the-cost-path-algorithm">Faster Processing of the Cost Path Algorithm</h2>
<p>The first step is to optimise the computational speed by a reduced area.
Another method is to improve the prediction of the medium resolution
itself and thus reduce the need for a computation in higher resolution.</p>
<h3 id="compare-least-cost-paths-from-rasters-of-both-alltouched-settings">Compare Least Cost Paths from rasters of both allÂ touched settings</h3>
<p>For the example paths shown, allÂ touched set to True overestimates ans
set to False underestimates the True costs.</p>
<p>A weighted average of the costs could therefore be a more accurate
measure and make estimated medium resolution Least Cost Path more
similar to high resolution paths. As above example shows the weighting
should favour allÂ touched to False.</p>
<p>This will speed-up the aggregation. The time needed for the back
tracking stays unchanged.</p>
<p>The optimal ratio of overlaying both allÂ touched for cost raster with
10Â m resolution is estimated via similarity of the resulting Least Cost
Path to the path of the original high resolution raster. The mean
distance of Least Cost Paths from rasters with different ratio is
estimated to the path from the allÂ touched set to False raster of the
higher (5Â m) resolution. TableÂ <a href="#tab:4">2</a>{reference-type=&ldquo;ref&rdquo;
reference=&ldquo;tab:4&rdquo;} shows, that the mean minimum distance decreases with
increasing ratio (1:1, 2:1, 4:1) and after this optimum is reached,
increases with increasing ratio (8:1, 16:1 and so on). Comparing the
similarity of the paths of the different ratios to normal paths with
10Â m resolution shows, that paths with a higher ratio of allÂ touched set
to True are nearer to the allÂ touched set to True paths. Paths with a
ratio in favour of allÂ touched False are much closer to the allÂ touched
set to False paths.</p>

resolution did not result in any benefits compared to an original medium
resolution raster. The aggregated cost per resolution of the Least Cost
Path from the downsampled raster is higher than the normal medium
resolution 10Â m raster. In addition, the distance from these paths to
the high resolution path is greater than the distance from the original
10Â m resolution path to the 5Â m resolution path (see

<h1 id="sec:discussion">Discussion</h1>
<p>In theory, the need for computing time increases with the resolution as
power of two. Similarly, the use of main memory increases. This again
limits the number of data points, that can be processed and the
resolution, and probably causes difference in increase of computation
time from power of 2 to a power of 2.2, because additional slower ram
moduls has been used for the aggregation of higher resolution.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the similarity to higher resolutions only scales
linear with the resolution. Thus, there is a diminishing return of
smaller errors, compared to compute time and resources used.</p>
<p>Therefore, this work attempts a) to reduce the computation power needed
and b) reduce the deviation for a given resolution compared to a higher
resolution raster.</p>
<p>For a), to reduce the computational complexity, clipping of the high
resolution has been applied, to reduce the search space of the
aggregation. While this method reduces the computation time and memory
usage, the backtracking part stays unchanged.</p>
<p>For b), two methods have been used to increase the similarity of the
paths computed from the medium resolution raster, to the paths of the
highest resolution raster. These methods are used as surrogates for the
more complex calculation of the Least Cost Path with the higher
resolution. In the first method a bi-linear downsampling of the higher
resolution raster has been applied and in the second method, the
allÂ touched set to False and True rasters were averaged in different
ratios, to compute the optimum weighted cost raster. While the second
method of using an averaged raster, shows a higher similarity to the
path from the highest resolution raster, the downsampling method is
simpler and does not need to be optimised for the given cost. This
disadvantage could be reduced by normalising the costs. The fact that
downsampling leads to paths that are closer to allÂ touched True, can be
attributed to the fact, that all objects are included, such as in to
allÂ touched True.</p>
<p>This shows that the way the cost raster is created in the first place
can play a crucial role in the end result. So, a nuance can cause a
detour. When this behaviour occurs, the polygon may not include the
Least Cost Path. This polygon should therefore be overlapped with a
polygon around the shortest path. For the set of control paths
downsampling could not outperform the original medium resolution
rasters.</p>
<p>Early stopping may result in suboptimal paths around the end points for
some edge cases, where the connection via another neighbour might be
more optimal.</p>
<p>The set of rules, that are used to create the intermediate cost raster,
includes a rule to create buffer around buildings which is set to the
level <em>Prohibited</em> areas. In all touched set to False rasters the
resolution of the medium level raster needs to be high enough to show
every detail, at least in the magnitude of the minimum object size plus
twice its buffer. This is true for the 10Â m resolution raster and less
true for the 25Â m resolution raster, that misses some details for roads
for all touched False raster. Other details such as rivers and houses
are already included in the lower resolution raster, due to larger
buffers. The raster with allÂ touched set to False might miss some
objects, but the missing chance is propotional to the object size and
the extent of overestimation is reduced. The Least Cost Path algorithm
searches for an optimal path as a line. As lines do not have a width,
the route found might contain bottlenecks, that have a smaller width
than the object that should be placed there. Therefore, the used
resolution should not be smaller than the width of the object that
should be placed. This can not be avoided by downsampling, but by
weighting the medium resolution allÂ touched True and False rasters.</p>
<p>This paper examines the effect of computational costs and deviation of
the results for a limited set of points. Also, only the cost of finding
the Least Cost Path from a single starting point to a single end point
has been considered. If multiple endpoints are used, the computational
cost for the aggregated cost raster has to be paid only once.</p>
<p>If multiple paths are calculated from a single raster, the speed-up
benefit is reduced. Especially pre-calculation on medium resolution
raster and clipping around a buffering of the resulting medium
resolution paths becomes less effective, because as the number of paths
increases, fewer pixels are clipped. The Least Cost Path algorithm does
only select the single most cost-effective path. Therefore, paths of
similar, but slightly higher costs remain unknown. In additional, slight
variations on the costs rasters can lead to very different paths,
although the costs will not change much. End-users may be interested in
selecting a path from a set of similar aggregated costs and applying
their own evaluation criteria. This can be achieved a by adjusting the
backtracking and return polygons, or by applying perturbation on the
costs.</p>
<p>In this work, the intermediate cost layers are aggregated by the maximum
function. Other possible aggregation functions are the sum and average
functions. Each aggregation function can be justified by a different
interpretation of the cost and its scale.</p>
<p>When the <em>Prohibited</em> level is used as the highest level, then summing
the two highest levels would result in a new highest level. Also, the
maximum function does not interfere with the nodata value. This can be
done by a nansum- / nanmean-function, if the nodata value is set to <em>not
a number</em> during the aggregation. The disadvantage of aggregation with
the maximum function is, that this aggregation is unable to distinguish
between nuances of different overlapping intermediate costs. On sum or
average aggregated rasters, one can distinguish between different
sublevels.</p>
<p>All touched False rasters produce more similar results than all touched
True raster, which is probably due to the fact, that the default level
is relatively low. As the default level increases, the effect would
probably be reduced for low resolution rasters. For high resolution
raster, the effect would still be present, because the use of the pixel
centre for sampling, reflects the original geometry better.</p>
<p>This effect of the similar aggregated costs per resolution could also be
seen in the test paths, even when the paths varied greatly. This could
be an indication of an even spatial distribution of the costs.</p>
<p>The allÂ touched set to True cost raster shows every detail, but the
sampling with allÂ touched set to True increases the size of the
features. The fact that the aggregated costs per resolution for all
touched True rasters overestimate the costs when computing the path from
a low resolution raster, might be due to the fact, that the high costs
are much more frequent, as they are exponential scaled.</p>
<h1 id="sec:conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The computing costs of the Least Cost Path scales with the square of the
resolution. The difference between the aggregated costs of the paths per
resolution computed from the allÂ touched set to False raster and the
allÂ touched set to True raster only shows a linear decrease. Therefore,
the gain in accuracy per compute time decreases. The presented methods
attempt to circumvent this bottleneck. When these strategies are applied
to a medium resolution raster, the compute time for high resolution
results can successfully be reduced without compromising the run time
for worse distances to the Least Cost Path from the high resolution
raster. The paths can change significantly even for a small change in
total cost. Therefore, developing an alternative backtracking algorithm,
that generates a corridor of costs might be a good strategy to offer
alternative paths and at the same time show variations between these
paths. An alternative would be to specify a range of costs and compute
the aggregation of the costs and than superimpose these aggregations and
compute the path by backtracking from the superimposed cost raster. This
again increases the computation time.</p>
<p>In an actual search for the Least Cost Path of a power, a survey could
be used as a method to estimate the costs. If the sample size of the
survey is large enough, the weights could take into account local
differences in relative acceptance.</p>
<p>Only changes in the algorithm have been applied in the search for
acceleration. Therefore, other methods such as just-in-time compilation
have not been tested.</p>
