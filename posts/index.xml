      <description>&lt;p&gt;GIS can change with current technology as Apache Arrow, and perhaps also Apache Spark und Apache Sedona.&#xA;Also in Pythonland Geopandas enhanced performance over time. In addition, I also wanted to try Dask und DuckDB.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please contact me, when you read this and think I could have increased the code quality and speed.&#xA;I use some public data, which still widely use shape files in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-data&#34;&gt;The Data&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First I load fhe ALKIS (register) building data for all counties in the state of Brandenburg.&#xA;All vector files are open data. The victor files are still offered as Shapefiles.&#xA;From the ALKIS Dataset of Brandenburg I used the buildings and the parcels (with land usage).&#xA;The files are stored per county!&#xA;The geometries have some errors which Geopandas auto-detects and fixes.&#xA;In addition, some file can not be opened with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://fiona.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html&#34;&gt;fiona&lt;/a&gt; library from Geopandas, with the error message&#xA;of multiple  geometry columns. Hence, we always use de new default: pyogrio.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>LDA and WordCloud on Mastodon Posts for the Bavarian State Election!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We selected a party as the dominant party, when this party or its&#xA;candidate was mentioned 50 % or more compared to other parties. But this&#xA;results in many posts that mention the candidates Söder, Aiwanger,&#xA;although the post is attribute to different parties. This mixed&#xA;attribution, which allows to mention different parties as long as there&#xA;is a clear dominant party, makes attribution hard, but was used to keep&#xA;as many posts as possible. Even though in some weeks we did not record&#xA;post for some smaller &amp;quot;dominant&amp;quot; parties.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I held a presentation on this project on Elixir MeetUp Berlin on Feb 8th, 2024. The slides can be found &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sehHeiden/MeetUpElixir/blob/main/presentation_MastodonElection.pdf&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Livebook code can be found &lt;a href=&#34;election_bavaria.livemd&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&#xA;The code for data collection can be found &lt;a href=&#34;./mastodon&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We try to predict voting result in the 2023 Bavarian state election in Germany by Mastodon posts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The last polls before the election show an average error of about 0.7 to 0.9 percent per major party. A time weighted average of the polls of the last six weeks before the election reduced the error to 0.39 percentage points per party.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Least Cost Path for Optimisation on Paths for Power Cables in North Germany</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;sec:introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction and Objectives&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The German power system is adding renewable energy sources in the north,&#xA;where wind energy plants reach their highest efficiency, due to higher&#xA;wind speeds. At the same time old power plants e.g. nuclear, hard coal&#xA;and lignite are being phased out [^eser-frey_analyzing_2012]. These&#xA;older power plants were mainly located in southern and central Germany.&#xA;The energy sink, industrial and private demand, is not shifting north.&#xA;Therefore, the renewable energy has to be transported from north to&#xA;south which increases the congestion in the power grid. The amount of&#xA;offshore wind power, that the German energy system can use, can be&#xA;greatly increased by adding new power lines &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
