In Pythonland, Geopandas has improved performance over time. I also wanted to try Dask, DuckDB and Apache Sedona.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Please contact me if you read this and think I could have improved the code quality and speed.
I use some public data, which is still widely used in Germany as shape files.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update&lt;/strong>: In the previous version I was not able to save to geoparquet with DuckDB. It works, it can be openmed inm QGIS, not so far no CRS.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Least Cost Path for Optimisation on Paths for Power Cables in North Germany</title><link>https://sehheiden.github.io/posts/cableroute/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sehheiden.github.io/posts/cableroute/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="sec:introduction">Introduction and Objectives&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The German power system is adding renewable energy sources in the north,
where wind energy plants reach their highest efficiency, due to higher
wind speeds. At the same time old power plants e.g. nuclear, hard coal
and lignite are being phased out &lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. These
older power plants were mainly located in southern and central Germany.
The energy sink, industrial and private demand, is not shifting north.
Therefore, the renewable energy has to be transported from north to
south which increases the congestion in the power grid. The amount of
offshore wind power, that the German energy system can use, can be
greatly increased by adding new power lines &lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
