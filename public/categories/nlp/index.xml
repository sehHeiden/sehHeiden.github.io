candidate was mentioned 50 % or more compared to other parties. But this
results in many posts that mention the candidates SÃ¶der, Aiwanger,
although the post is attribute to different parties. This mixed
attribution, which allows to mention different parties as long as there
is a clear dominant party, makes attribution hard, but was used to keep
as many posts as possible. Even though in some weeks we did not record
post for some smaller &amp;quot;dominant&amp;quot; parties.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mastodon - Election Predictions</title><link>https://sehheiden.github.io/posts/mastodon_on_bavarian_elecvtion/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sehheiden.github.io/posts/mastodon_on_bavarian_elecvtion/</guid><description>&lt;p>I held a presentation on this project on Elixir MeetUp Berlin on Feb 8th, 2024.

&lt;h1 id="abstract">Abstract&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>We try to predict voting result in the 2023 Bavarian state election in Germany by Mastodon posts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The last polls before the election show an average error of about 0.7 to 0.9 percent per major party. A time weighted average of the polls of the last six weeks before the election reduced the error to 0.39 percentage points per party.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
