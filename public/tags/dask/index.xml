In Pythonland, Geopandas has improved performance over time. I also wanted to try Dask, DuckDB and Apache Sedona.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Please contact me if you read this and think I could have improved the code quality and speed.
I use some public data, which is still widely used in Germany as shape files.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update&lt;/strong>: In the previous version I was not able to save to geoparquet with DuckDB. It works, it can be openmed inm QGIS, not so far no CRS.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
