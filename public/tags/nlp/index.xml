candidate was mentioned 50 % or more compared to other parties. But this
results in many posts that mention the candidates SÃ¶der, Aiwanger,
although the post is attribute to different parties. This mixed
attribution, which allows to mention different parties as long as there
is a clear dominant party, makes attribution hard, but was used to keep
as many posts as possible. Even though in some weeks we did not record
post for some smaller &amp;quot;dominant&amp;quot; parties.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
