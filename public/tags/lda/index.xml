      <description>&lt;p&gt;We selected a party as the dominant party, when this party or its&#xA;candidate was mentioned 50 % or more compared to other parties. But this&#xA;results in many posts that mention the candidates SÃ¶der, Aiwanger,&#xA;although the post is attribute to different parties. This mixed&#xA;attribution, which allows to mention different parties as long as there&#xA;is a clear dominant party, makes attribution hard, but was used to keep&#xA;as many posts as possible. Even though in some weeks we did not record&#xA;post for some smaller &amp;quot;dominant&amp;quot; parties.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
