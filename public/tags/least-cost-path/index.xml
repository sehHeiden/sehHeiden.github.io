&lt;p>The German power system is adding renewable energy sources in the north,
where wind energy plants reach their highest efficiency, due to higher
wind speeds. At the same time old power plants e.g. nuclear, hard coal
and lignite are being phased out &lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. These
older power plants were mainly located in southern and central Germany.
The energy sink, industrial and private demand, is not shifting north.
Therefore, the renewable energy has to be transported from north to
south which increases the congestion in the power grid. The amount of
offshore wind power, that the German energy system can use, can be
greatly increased by adding new power lines &lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
